# Commanded scheduler

One-off and recurring command scheduler for [Commanded](https://github.com/commanded/commanded) CQRS/ES applications using [Ecto](https://github.com/elixir-ecto/ecto) for persistence.

Commands can be scheduled in one of two ways:

- Using the `Commanded.Scheduler` module as described in the [Example usage](#example-usage) section.
- By [dispatching a scheduled command](#dispatch-scheduled-command) using your app's router or from within a process manager.

```elixir
Commanded.Scheduler.schedule_once(reservation_id, %TimeoutReservation{..}, ~N[2020-01-01 12:00:00])
```

This library is under active development.
